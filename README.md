# Exadel Booking
This project was written during the internship at a company Exadel. We had to develop an application for booking place in an office. Three developpers worked on frontend and other two on backend of our application. As frontend developpers we used stack of technologies such as Angular9, TypeScript, Store (NgRx), Angular material, Bootstrap4, SCSS and FabricJs.
During this project I had the next responsibilities included:
- Creating application with Angular (TypeScript, Bootstrap4, SCSS);
- Investigation and implementation new library(Fabric.js)
- Bug-fixing and Support tasks;
- Implementation new features;
- Communication with Product Owner;
- Development of application structure;
- Meetings;

It was my first experience with teamwork wich was very valuable for me. Also I significantly improved my GIT skill.
